README

This plugin is intended to show and explain how to create a custom index on your elgg site
This plugin doesn't do anything useful by itself, and superficially it is the same as the
bundled custom_index, however in this plugin I strive to explain exactly how the code is working
in order to foster a better understanding of elgg as opposed to simple copy/paste code replacement
 
There are a few assumptions made about your level of understanding.
1. You have read the docs and know about the basic file structure of a plugin
2. You have a decent understanding of PHP


Usage

Install the plugin as normal
Open and read start.php to see how to overwrite Elggs index
Open and read pages/index.php to see how to create your index
